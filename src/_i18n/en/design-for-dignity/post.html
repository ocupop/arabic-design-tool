<div class="text-left editable">
  <p>Moroccan social designer and researcher, Sarah Fathallah, ran a workshop in Lebanon in December 2018 to help
    experienced
    designers translate their skills to the social sector. She found that designers had three main considerations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structure and language of the social sector</li>
    <li>Methods and ethics of work with vulnerable communities</li>
    <li>The role of a designer in the social sector</li>
  </ul>
