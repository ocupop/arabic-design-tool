  <p>50% of Syrian households have a family member with a chronic illness. About half of Syrians with chronic illness
  couldn’t access their medicine in 2016, with financial barriers being a key obstacle. At the same time, pharmaceutical
  producers pay to dispose unused medications every year.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the problem, the Medicine Bank team faced a number of institutional constraints for their solution
  and they had to get feedback from a range of legal experts, drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and patients who suffer from
  chronic illness. They would receive contradicting feedback and this tool helped the team find those common links.</p>

  <p>For example, the team thought about recovering stagnant medicines from pharmacies, which could save pharmacies money on
  storing and destroying about-to-expire medicines. T Medicine Bank took their idea to a pharmacy, The pharmacy told them
  that they shouldn’t pursue the idea because drug manufacturers will be an obstacle to them. Reflecting on their
  feedback, they decided that instead they needed to interview drug manufacturers. In their meeting, manufacturers indeed
  validated that they do have excess supplies of medicine and that it’s costly for them to get rid of them.</p>

  <p>Their final solution is a supply chain management tool that connects diabetes and hypertension medicine approaching
  expiry to vulnerable chronic disease patients through contracts with drug manufacturers and local pharmacies.</p>
