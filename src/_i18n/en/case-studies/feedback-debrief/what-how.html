  <p>When you pitch or present prototypes of a solution, you will inevitably receive feedback from different people. There
  may be a common thread among comments. Or some of it might not even be useful to your solution.</p>
  <p>First, write down who you received feedback from and their comments. Then, reflect on what they said and think about
  what was positive about your current solution and what needs improvement. Finally, create a plan on how to action out
  the most important feedback and refine your solution.</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="/en/tools/design-research-plan">design research plan</a> to prepare for interviews with potential users or experts. The <a href="/en/tools/persona">persona tool</a> can help you focus on who you’re designing for. <a href=”/tools/how-we-might-question-template”>The “How
    Might We” question template</a> will help you re-articulate your challenge statement and help you refine your
    solution.</p>
