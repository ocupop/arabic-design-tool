  <p>Vulnerable people can’t afford housing and rent in Jordan due to a combination of low income and high living costs.
    Ahmed knew he wanted to connect people to housing opportunities but he didn’t know how to go about it.</p>

  <p>He had the idea of house-sharing platform to reduce money and time spent commuting to far-away jobs, but he looked
    at
    other existing service models to turn it into a service platform and make it scalable.</p>

  <p>Ahmed ended up with a web-based platform that connects people to house-sharing opportunities and housemates near
    work to
    lower the monthly expenses of low-wage workers.</p>
