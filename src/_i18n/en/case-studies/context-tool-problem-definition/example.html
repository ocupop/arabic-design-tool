  <p>Jordan has the highest number of deaf students in the region. There are only 10 public schools for deaf children, which
  are distributed unequally around the country. 80% of deaf children are illiterate. Many parents struggle to communicate
  with their children, as they donâ€™t have access to resources for formal Arabic sign language. Often, they invent their
  own form of sign language, leaving children unable to communicate with other people, including other hearing impaired
  people.</p>

  <p>The team behind <a href="https://startnetwork.org/news-and-blogs/innovative-learning-tool-jordan%E2%80%99s-deaf-children" target="_blank">Martha</a> researched the problem and came up with their challenge statement: <strong>How might we provide
  interactive visual education for children with hearing disabilities to enable them to read and write?</strong> To break down how
  this problem affects different contexts, they filled in the tool as below:</p>

  <p>The team developed educational cards paired with an augmented reality app. Their aim was to improve communication and literacy skills of deaf children and their families in formal sign language. The app was developed to be used at home.
