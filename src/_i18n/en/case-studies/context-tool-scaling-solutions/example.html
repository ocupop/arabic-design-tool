  <p>Jordan has the highest number of deaf students in the region. There are only 10 public schools for deaf children, which
  are distributed unequally around the country. 80% of deaf children are illiterate. Many parents struggle to communicate
  with their children, as they donâ€™t have access to resources for formal Arabic sign language. Often, they invent their
  own form of sign language, leaving children unable to communicate with other people, including other hearing impaired
  people.</p>

  <p>After having developed their solution, the team behind <a href="http://marthateam.com/" target="_blank">Martha</a> worked with this diagram to understand how their solution
  could be scaled. For example, this solution could also be adapted by teachers.</p>
