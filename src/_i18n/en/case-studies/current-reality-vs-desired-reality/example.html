  <p>In Jordan, 30% of children fail math and around the third grade, they face the risk of repeating grades for the first
  time. Low-income families cannot afford tutoring or supplemental services to help children falling behind in class and
  if their guardians don’t have a high level of education to support them individually, children risk failing and
  eventually dropping out of school.</p>
  
  <p>Abdullah, Asma’a, Nebras, and Mohammad wanted to explore the role of parents and teachers and test who would be the most
  effective user in solving this problem. This tool helped them map out the current day-to-day journey of low-income
  students and what a desired reality might look like for them. Initially, they focused on a solution that would build the
  capacity of teachers, but through this activity, they realized that teachers are already overworked. They shifted their
  intended user to parents with low-literacy and numeracy, developing a low-cost curriculum supplement that empowers them
  to teach their children key skills through modeling activities that can be done in their home.</p>
