  <h2>What and How</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a specific space from your neighborhood, such as a butcher shop, grocery store, a public park or even hair salon, and brainstorm how you might transform it.</li>
    <li>Come up with at least three ways the chosen space could be transformed into a space that solves the problem.</li>
    <li>Present your ideas to the affected persons in the community and collect their feedback.</li>
    <li>Reflect on that feedback, re-formulate your strongest idea with that feedback and mind.</li>
    <li>Create paper prototypes and present it back to your user group. A paper prototype can include a storyboard [link], mobile app[link], website[link], or even a conversation between two people[link].</li>
  </ol>
  <p>*Ideally, you’ll want lots of room to write or draw for this activity, so either print this exercise on A2 size paper or
  draw this template out on a whiteboard. But if neither are available, a simple piece of paper will work too!</p>

  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <p>7/10 Syrian students have experienced bullying, while 55% of all students in Jordan have experienced bullying. Bullying
  has shown to have a significant impact on a student’s learning experience and academic performance. The team wanted to
  focus on increasing student’s social emotional skills, but didn’t know where to begin.</p>

  <p>In many schools in Jordan, the school day is split into two — in the morning, Jordanians go to school, while in the
  afternoon, Syrians go to school. The team observed that bullying typically occurs during that transition period, when
  Jordanian students are leaving and Syrian students are just arriving. This presented an opportunity for the team.</p>
