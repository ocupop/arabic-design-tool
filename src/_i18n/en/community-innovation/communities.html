<h1 class="text-center editable"><strong>Community Tools</strong></h1>
<div class="editable">
  <p>Community members have important shared knowledge, language, and collective understanding, which enables them to surface
  important insights about problems and potential solutions. They can leverage existing resources and networks to create
  homegrown solutions. By helping individuals access new skills and opportunities, and making key connections with
  experts, peers, and businesses, we can help power these solutions and drive them forward.</p>

  <p>A number of tools have been developed from the Mahali Lab using a human-centered design approach. These tools can help
  you work with vulnerable communities and empower individuals or community groups to frame and communicate the pressing
  problems they’re facing and enable creative problem-solving.</p>
