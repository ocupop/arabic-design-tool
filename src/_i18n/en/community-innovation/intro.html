  <p>In Jordan, the Mahali Lab at the International Rescue Committee works with Syrian refugees and socially and economically
  vulnerable community members to identify and solve challenges posed by long-term displacement. People from within
  communities can acutely understand them from the inside, but many donâ€™t have access to training, resources, and networks
  to translate them into solutions.</p>

  <p>Mahali Lab undertook three participatory design challenges to foster community engagement in developing solutions to
  three major issues: access to basic income, improving health services, and strengthening education. Participants built
  up entrepreneurial teams while working to solve these major challenges. They were able to access co-working space,
  financial support and access to experts, such as analysts and human-centered designers. The IRC works with teams with
  the most promising solutions in an effort to find funding and support their implementation, validation and scaling.
