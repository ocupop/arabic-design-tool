  <p>Communities approach, understand and solve problems differently. Community members have important shared knowledge,
  language, and collective understanding, which enables them to surface important insights about problems and potential
  solutions. They can leverage existing resources and networks to create homegrown solutions. By helping individuals
  access new skills and opportunities, and making key connections with experts, peers, and businesses, we can help power
  these solutions and drive them forward.</p>

  <p>This set of tools should enable you to work with socially and economically vulnerable communities to understand complex, opaque, rapidly-shifting problems, and support them in thinking through potential breakthrough solutions. In particular, these tools can help you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Go beyond the status quo</li>
    <li>Think through, understand, and manage power relationships in productive ways</li>
    <li>Partner with changemakers within affected communities</li>
    <li>Create and use relationships to make change</li>
    <li>Work within communities ethically and responsibly</li>
  </ul>
