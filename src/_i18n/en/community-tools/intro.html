<div class="text-center editable">
  <p>People from within communities experiencing challenges can acutely understand them from the inside, but many don’t have
  access to the same skills, resources, and networks to translate them into solutions.</p>

  <p>Working in Jordan with Syrian refugees and vulnerable community members, the Mahali Lab at International Rescue
  Committee is a community-driven innovation initiative designed to work with community members to identify problems and
  develop local solutions to them. Mahali has developed a number of tools using a human-centered design approach.</p>

  <p>These tools can help you work with vulnerable communities and empower individuals or community groups to frame and
  communicate the pressing problems they’re facing and enable creative problem-solving.</p>
